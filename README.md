## General info
This is my portfolio page demonstrating the projects and homework assignments I have done throughout the coding bootcamp.  In this page, I chose to use the Card display style to present information to the reader.  

The page contains 4 homework assignments and 2 projects.  Furthermore, it provides links to my github, linkedIn and resume pages.
